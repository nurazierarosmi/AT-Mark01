# AT-Mark01

It is an artifact monitoring system where temperature sensor (DHT11), ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) and force resistive sensor(FSR) are used. Arduino UNO R3 is used as the microcontroller.
Temp sensor is to state whether the temperature is suitable for the artifact or not. The ultrasonic sensor detects the human presence in front of the artifact and FSR detects the presence of the artifact. 
Library DHT11 and LiquidCrystal_I2C are used.

The source code to the AT-Mark01 is named as below:
Finalproject_AT-Mark01.ino
